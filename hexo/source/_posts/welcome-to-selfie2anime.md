    Welcome to Selfie2Anime.com! Here's a quick introduction of what this and what you can expect
    to find on this blog in the near future.

Hey guys! We have decided to set up this blog to give a little bit more insight into the development, infrastructure, and progress of [Selfie2Anime.com](https://selfie2anime.com). We'll be tackling the relevant topics from a more technical perspective, so if you're into this kind of stuff like we are, be sure to let us know on Twitter [@RicoBeti](https://twitter.com/RicoBeti) and [@nathangloverAUS](https://twitter.com/nathangloverAUS) or in the comments down below and keep checking this blog every once in a while for more updates! :smile:

# Introducing: Selfie2Anime

{% floater thumbnail.png Selfie2Anime %}
[Selfie2Anime.com](https://selfie2anime.com) is a free webservice that lets you upload a picture of yourself and in generates an anime-style character which is based on your selfie. The technology behind the conversion function is called a [Generative Adversarial Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network), or GAN for short. GANs are a relatively new concept in machine-learning that has invented in 2014. The specific GAN we are using for Selfie2Anime is derived from the excellent work by *Junho Kim*, *Minjae Kim*, *Hyeonwoo Kang*, and *Kwanghee Lee*, [which they have made accessible on Github](https://github.com/taki0112/UGATIT), along with sample data and pre-trained models. [Their research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10830) is available online as well. :gasp:

We have set up both the front-end and the back-end of this website a week ago on Friday 16th, 2019. In the same spirit of the researches mentioned above, we have open-sourced [Selfie2Anime on Github](https://github.com/SilentByte/selfie2anime-site) as well, including the [back-end service](https://github.com/t04glovern/selfie2anime) and [this blog](https://github.com/SilentByte/selfie2anime-blog).

# First Results are In
Below are a few examples that have been generated based on selfies submitted by some of our early users. We've been positively surprised by how well this technology performs. :smile: Although, of course, not everything goes well all the time (or even most of the time, to be honest :crazy:), and there are some --- rather unfortunate --- "creations" generated by the GAN. We'll address some obvious shortcomings in future posts. For now, here's what's possible on the happy-path:

For privacy reasons, of course, we cannot and will not share the original selfies of the beautiful people that have been a part of this journey thus far. *However, we are actively seeking people that would give us permission to share their anime-selfies along with their original photos.*
