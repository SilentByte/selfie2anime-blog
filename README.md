# Selfie2Anime Blog

This repository contains the source code and content files of the Blog associated with [Selfie2Anime.com](https://selfie2anime.com).

## Development / Editing

The Bash file `s2a.sh` located in the root folder is used to drive the development and editing process, featuring several useful commands:


### Local Server

To start a local test server with hot-reload, run:

```bash
$ ./s2a.sh dev 
```

### Build Blog

To build the blog for deployment, run:

```bash
$ ./s2a.sh build
```

For testing purposes, `DISABLE_IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION` can be turned on to reduce build time:

```bash
$ DISABLE_IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION=1 ./s2a.sh build
```

### Creating a New Post

New posts can be generated by running `s2a.sh` with the `new` command and a `slug` as its argument:

```bash
$ ./s2a.sh new welcome-to-selfie2anime.md
```

A new folder will be created for storing the post's assets/images, along with a `*.md` Markdown file for the content. Just fill out the front-matter correctly and start blogging.

*Note that there is a requirement for you to create a thumbnail image called `thumbnail.png` in the post's folder, which will be used for SEO and on the article hub.*

Several custom tags can be used in the blog post. Check out `welcome-to-selfie2anime.md` for how to use and structure them.
